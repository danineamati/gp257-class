Although the problems in this lab are not from *Python Numerical Methods*, please read [Chapter-9](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter09.00-Representation-of-Numbers.html). Pay particular attention to the *Round-off Errors* secion, but the first two sections are mostly FYI; however, these sections provide an understanding of how most computational systems represent fractional numbers via binary numbers.\n",

Suppose you are writting a specific code, and you know that none of the operations will result in negative values, what other interger type (dtype) could use for 32-bit and 64-bit numpy arrays that would extend the maximum interger value that the arrays could correctly represent? ([Hint](https://programmercave0.github.io/blog/2019/10/19/Bit-Manipulation-in-C-and-C++))\n",

    "1. Python Integers are variable length. In this case, it lengthened from an integer specified with a 31 bit length to an integer with a 32 bit length. In contrast, NumPy Integers have a fixed size. So, for example, we specified a 32 bit integer (where one bit is used for the sign). So, when we requested to add, it overflowed by one bit and looped around to the negative numbers. \n",
    "2. We can use unsigned integers. Using an unsigned integer doubled the size of the maximum integer value. In doing so, it overflows to zero rather than to negative numbers.\n",
    "3. Python and NumPy are smart, but subtle. When we store the variable asan array, NumPy has to maintain the same type for each variable and store each element with the allocated memory footprint of the given type. NumPy is trying to avoid the case where one value of a large array is about to overflow and then decide that it needs to upgrade the whole array from int32 to int64. That would generally be a big waste of memory. However, if we only have one value, NumPy is willing to make the change and request more memory. So, it dynamically casts the number from int32 to int64. \n",

    "0. Apparently, the smallest `numpy.float32` is `1.401298464324817e-45`, according to numpy.\n",
    "1. As far as I can see, the value in A0 (above) is the smallest `numpy.float32` that we can represent, albeit way larger than the smallest `numpy.float64` that we can represent (see Part B). \n",
    "2. None\n",
    "3. Now, when we square the number, we underflow immediately and do not typecast to float64. Like the previous problem, it seems that numpy does not want to use the typecast approach for arrays. I hypothesize that the design choice is similar to above. If we typecast `float32` to `float64` to have values smaller than `smallest_subnormal` as `float32`, we will have to change the allocation and double the memory footprint, which could be expensive and annoying for large arrays.\n",
    "4. The underflow occurs at 0.5 (exactly) since this is 1/2 of the smallest number and we have passed the gap between floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B\n",
    "To make sense of what is happening with `numpy.float64`, I started by reducing the exponent from mf32. We can actually multiply mf32 (AKA the value in A0) by $10^{-278}$ before we cannot represent it anymore. However, we begin losing precision in the decimal point. To illustrate this, I included $10^{-275}$ through $10^{-279}$. This matches the description on the linked wikipedia page:\n",
    "> By filling the underflow gap like this, significant digits are lost, but not as abruptly as when using the flush to zero on underflow approach (discarding all significant digits when underflow is reached). Hence the production of a subnormal number is sometimes called gradual underflow because it allows a calculation to lose precision slowly when the result is small.\n",
    "> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_number\n",

    "With that, the direct responses are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. The smallest `numpy.float64` is `5e-324`. \n",
    "1. In part A, numpy promoted the float from `numpy.float32` to `numpy.float64`. However, numpy does not do this with `numpy.float64`. Namely, it does not promote from `numpy.float64` to `numpy.float128`. Instead, it immediately underflows.\n",
    "2. None\n",
    "3. In this case, the array has the same behavior as the number alone. The array also immediately overflows without typecasting. \n",
    "4. Again, the underflow occurs at 0.5 since this is 1/2 of the smallest number and we have passed the gap between floats.\n",
    "5. Ultimately, this is a design decision. Numpy is willing to promote from `numpy.float32` to `numpy.float64`, but it is not willing to promote from `numpy.float64` to `numpy.float128`."

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, were are going to examine [Truncation](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2003/pests/2002/lectures/07.1_FloatingPoint/truncation.htm?CurrentSlide=6) errors, which are related to Round-off errors. An example of when you might encounter truncation errors is when solving integrals (a sequence of summations) on a computer. Given that we mostly work with computers that have finite precision arithematic, we must represent integrals as finite summations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate truncation errors we are going to sum all the integer values from $1$ to $N$, but were are going to represent each integer as a numpy.float32 type. In the cell below, I've writen a function that finds the analyical solution to $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}i$, for a given $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job (write responses in the markdown cell below):\n",
    "* First, create a Numpy array of size $N$ containing numpy.float32 values representing the integers from $1-N$, and have the values stored in consective indexing order (i.e. arr[0] = 1.0, arr[1] = 2.0, ..., arr[N-1] = N.0).\n",
    "* Next, you need to create function that calculates and returns the sum of this array (make it fast, and feel free to use numpy functions). Besure to verify that your sum is the same as the analytical sum. I suggest starting with an array of just 10 elements, so $N=10$.\n",
    "* Once you have verified that your sumation function is returning the correct results, you have two tasks:\n",
    "    1. Find the value of $N_{inc}$ at which your summation is no longer corret. Discuss in the markdown cell below how you found this value. \n",
    "    2. Write an improved summation that can correctly sum all the values to find the answer of $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{2\\cdot N_{inc}}$ (the sum upto $2\\cdot N_{inc}$). Discuss your reasoning about how you chose to solve this task.\n",
    "    3. Special Case: If you are taking this course for 4-units, then write a recursive function recur_sum() that can solve problem 2. All values must remain as numpy.float32 values (no type-casting). Then test your fuction for $4\\cdot N_{inc}$ (it should be accurate without any changes, but if it's not, that's ok).\n",
