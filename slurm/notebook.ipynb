    "In this lab you will learn some of the basics of slurm and a few of the more advanced features that you might helpful in the future. We will be doing this lab on our class cluster but everything we are doing will also work on Stanford's Sherlock system (or any other slurm cluster) often with more interesting results because they are bigger more complex systems.\n",

    "Slurm is a workload manager. Its jobs is to efficiently and fairly provide cluster resources. A slurm controlled cluster is ususally broken up into parittions where different sets of rules on use and are often composed of different hardware.  You use slurm resources by making a request to the slurm controller node for resources.  Your request is evaluated for priority based on what are referred to as \"fairshare\" rules. When there are free resources and you have the top priority you are granted access."

In general you get to use these resources until someone who has/or is willing to pay/has paid a higher cost. At Stanford, the Sherlock clusters owner's queue operates in this manner. If you submit a job to the queue it will use all free resources if the owner of the resource requests those resources your job will be killed. GCP has the concept of preemitbible nodes, which opperate at a much lower cost, but the jobs can be killed at any time.\n",
